Tool to assist in mushroom cultivation projects

Mushroom cultivation involves a lot of moving parts. As cultivators we like to experiment and tweak our substrate recipes, humidity and other atmospheric conditions, monotub/fruiting chamber design, and our various teks we employ throughout our growing process. This is a simple app (basically a database schema) to help keep track of how we are growing and what our results look like.

The bulk of this project is in the 'cultivation' app.

There is also a 'scraping' app that I intended to use to scrape various shroomery.org forum posts by community members who have been granted the coveted 'TrustedCultivator' status. That website has been a goldmine of information and I've learned so much from the trusted cultivators there. I thought by scraping all of their posts I could generate a handy keyword reference lookup app. But to my dismay I found there is no way to scrape all posts by a single user if that user has thousands of posts. From their user profile, the posts you can view only go back so far.
